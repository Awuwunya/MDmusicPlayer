* v0.0
  . Initial release
  > http://natsumi.eu/dl/MDMusicPlayer/MDMusicPlayer.0.0.7z
================================================================================

* v0.1
  + Full support for voices
  + Support for conversion of sound effects
  + Fake DMA feature, allows to check sound quality degredation under different
    loads
  + Scripts for World of Illusion and Sonic the Hedgehog 2
  + Sonic 1 port of invinciblity theme from Sonic & Knuckles
  + Changelog
  * Included both asm and bin format music, for future reference
  * Changed "sTone" to "VolEnv"
  - Penis
  s+ Debug output as a commandline option
  s+ Multiple scripts per folder. See smps2asm.txt for more info
  s+ Go To, Equate Change and Comment functions
  s* Voices which are not at the end of file would continue to be created til
    end of file. This would eventually cause the ASM file to be messy and not
    work correctly.
  s* ReadWord function would read the first byte twice, and therefore break any
    code that uses it.
  s* Some miscellaneous crash issues
  s* Script parser would not support multiple condition blocks. False condition
    would get overwritten by another condition block, and then it would
    incorrectly run instructions when it should not. Now this also uses a stack
    and supports theoretically infinite condition blocks.
  s* Lable formats can now use variables or operators
  s* lable format would place ':' in wrong places or not at all with some setups
    This has now been corrected to always put one at the end.
  s* Various optimizations

================================================================================

* v0.2
  + Revised the SMPS2ASM format and definitions (to be more accurate and
    simpler)
  + Added an external tool to assemble all music data.
  + Because of MusicTool, we have also now ditched the s2e_[driver]_ suffix from
    macro names!
  + Now channels show the tempo in addition to other fields
  * smps2asm.txt and mdmusicplayer.txt updated to have actually up-to-date
     information
  * Sound drivers are defined in separate file now, to allow MusicTool to work
  * Fixed Sonic 1 volume envelopes; VolEnv_00 is hardcoded!
  * Reconverted all files to match the new format
  * Updated all smps2asm scripts and definition files to match the new format
  * Filenames can now have spaces and other special symbols that was not
    possible earlier
  s+ Wrote a completely new UI for defining conversion parameters
  s+ You can decide if the program pauses or produces debug output from the UI
  s+ Replaced =comment with the builtin comment feature for macros
  s+ Added subscript importing
  s* Argument equates are now parsed to exist like normal Equates, and can be
    referenced later in the program
  s* Program warns if required subscripts are found, rather than just crashing
  s* Improved error reporting for Dictionary invocation
  s- Removed smpsHeaderStartSong hack, now each script can define it by
    themselves!

================================================================================

* v0.4
  + Ristar SMPS2ASM scripts
  + Megaman The Wily Wars SMPS2ASM scripts
  * Migrate to new SMPS2ASM format
  * Add few voice-only scripts
  * Voices -> Patches
  * Fixed a bug that would cause MDMusicPlayer to not properly function on
    hardware
  s+ You can now create labels at any address you desire
  s+ New operator that allows you to get the current "program counter" (Offset
    of the song + current offset inside of the song file) ("pc")
  s+ Operator that returns the offset of the file ("of")
  s+ Operator that returns the size of the entire file ("sz")
  s+ Operator that allows SMPS2ASM find the next already defined lable, that is
    after the current "program counter" ("an")
  s+ Operator that allows SMPS2ASM find the previous already defined lable, that
    is before the current "program counter" ("al")
  s* Operators for Ristar-specific offsets
  s* Reversed label parsing, so that patches may be evaluated last
  s* Now . (dot) is used as operator symbol, over / which was used before.
  s* Fixed some cases where strings with decimal points failed to be parsed as
    longs.
  s- Remove the hacky method of resolving patches in favour of using the new
    operators.
  s- sHeaderInit is no longer hardcoded
