    * 3 - Inner functionality
================================================================================

*1 - Commandline, basic usage & introduction.*
  *1.1 - Introduction*
    SMPS2ASM/Nat is specifically tailored to go with the MDMusicPlayer, and
    therefore may not be optimal outside of it. SMPS2ASM/Nat works using
    scripting files to convert music. The advantage is that it can support
    theoretically any SMPS format sound driver, or even similar formats.
    Scripting is fairly easy, even if a little intuitive for a first timer. See
    chapter 2 and 3 for more info.

  *1.2 - Basic usage*
    To convert SMPS, put it into the Music folder, then go to exe and lauch
    SMPS2ASM.exe. The application will ask you some necessary questions to
    convert the file. Remember, the symbol for hex number is '0x'.

  *1.3 - Commandline*
    The commandline for the program will be similar than what you would input
    into the prompt itself. Do note, some scripts may require additional
    parameters. You can put them right after the other parameters. Here is an
    example:
      "SMPS2ASM ICZ.bin Sonic3K IceCap1 0x86AA"

    If you want to use another script inside a folder, you can append a dot, and
    the unique name of the script. You can see this with scripts related to SFX.
    For example with script "S1_SMPS/smps2asm script.SFX.asm", you would want to
    append ".SFX" to the folder name, as follows:
      "SMPS2ASM Jump.bin Sonic1.SFX Jump"

  *1.4 - Special flags*
    The commandline supports you adding special flags to use different special
    functions with SMPS2ASM. Currently the following flags are supported:
      * -d - Print debug information. This information provides an insight to
        what the interpreter sees during the whole execution. This file is
        stored as .asm.log file and is viewable by any text editor. This can be
        used to debugging possible issues with scripts or finding out what goes
        wrong with song conversion.

    More flags may be added in the future
================================================================================

*2 - Scripting & mnemonics*
  *2.1 - Basic scripting*
    Scripting in SMPS2ASM/Nat works based on functions; you define a function on
    the main script, then the program evaluates if this function should be
    executed. There also can be equates, which will be evaluated when they are
    first found (That is, not at script parse time, but when the script at its
    location is ran first). Scripts are split into subscripts, which are user
    defined, in order to be ran or used by the code to aid in conversion
    process.

  *2.2 - Mnemonics*
    *2.2.1 - Function types*
      The very basic type of scripting, Function types, serves to tell to the
      program what type of function we want to execute. This is the whole
      backbone of the program, and determines what the rest of the line should
      be. Here is the types:
        * Equate - Equates a symbol or value to a lable. The program may put the
          result in the output file. The symbol for this operation is '='

        * Macro - Macros are used to print just that; macros. Macros allow to
          define one, multiple or no bytes that trigger the macro. The macro
          is able to define arguments as well. The symbol for this operation
          is '!'

        * Script block start - This is used to start a script block or
          conditional script block, which may be used to run specific script
          after a function. This may be used to modify the output of the
          previous function or do something after it. The symbol is usually
          used after the function line. The symbol for this operation is '{'

        * Script block end - Similar to script block start, but is used to end a
          script block. Only to be used in a separate line. The symbol for this
          operation is '}'

        * Subscript - This function is much like 'Script block start', but it is
          its own function, over than extension of an existing function. Mostly
          used to make a subscript of a specified type, which the interpreter
          will use to define output file. You can also import a subscript into
          another subscript or script block. The max depth of importing is 3.
          The symbol for this operation is '?'

        * Argument modifier - This adds the functionality to modify an argument
          of a macro. It can be defined it to one argument only, and will change
          equated value to its lable. The symbol for this operation is ':'

        * If block - This function is used to run alternate code based on
          condition. If blocks can also contain only true condition. The symbol
          for this operation is 'Â¤'

        * Operation - This function allows you to fake operators without them
          actually outputting anything to the output file. Most useful in
          skipping bytes (for example, DAC pointers two unused bytes). The
          symbol for this operation is '$'

        * For loop - This operation can be used to loop for x amount of times.
          Useful in defining FM and PSG headers with variable length. The
          symbol for this operation is '*'

        * Argument equate - This function will try to get an argument from the
          commandline and equate it to a lable. If it can not find equate at the
          requested offset, it will ask from the user with the given string.
          Most used to get the offset of the song in Z80 bank. The symbol for
          this operation is '@'

        * Stop - This function is used to stop interpreting data at current
          offset, and to return to the function which called this (usually
          a jump or call). If no caller was present, parsing of the file will
          stop and final file will be output. See further explanation in
          chapter 3.3. The symbol for this operation is ';'

        * Lable format - Is used to set the lable format used in different
          operations. Mostly used by jumps, calls and header. The symbol for
          this operation is '~'

        * Comment - Is used to set a note in the asm file. Can also be used to
          set custom operations when necessary. You can use operators inside
          comments and they are set on a new line. If placed inside a macro,
          the comment will be appended after the macro itself. The symbol for
          this operation is '%'

        * Print - This can be used in order to print text to the command window.
          This works almost like a Comment operation, but will not put anything
          in the output file. The symbol for this operation is '+'

        * Go to - This operator is used to go to file position, or advance
          specified amount of bytes forward or backward. Useful for writing
          comments or with complex commands. You define absolute position
          ("a"), backwards jump ("b"), or forwards jump ("f") right after the
          operation symbol. The symbol for this operation is '>'

        * Arbitary Lable - This operator is used to create a lable at specific
          position inside the file. It is useful for creating arbitary lables
          and letting the interpreter know where specific type of data is at.
          You may control the lable name with a lable format. The symbol for
          this operation is '^'

    *2.2.2 - Operators*
      There are some special operators that allow to better interact with
      equates or bytes of the input file. The operator to interact with an
      equate goes as follows: '\<str>\' where str is the name of the equate.
      Other operators start with '/' and have 2-letter code;
        * db - Data Byte; Reads a byte from the file on current cursor position,
          and then increments the cursor position by 1.

        * lb - Last Byte; Reads a byte from the file on current cursor position
          minus 1.

        * nb - Next Byte; Reads a byte from the file on current cursor
          position.

        * sb - Skip Byte; Increments the cursor position by 1, but does not
          read a byte.

        * dw - Data Word; Reads a word from the file on current cursor
          position, and then increments the cursor position by 2.

        * lw - Last Word; Reads a word from the ROM on current cursor position
          minus 2.

        * nw - Next Word; Reads a word from the ROM on current cursor position.

        * sw - Skip Word; Increments the cursor position by 2, but does not
          read a word.

        * aw - Absolute Word; Reads a word from the file on current cursor
          position, treats it as an absolute pointer (usually to Z80 bank).
          Then the data at destination position will be interpreted.

        * ow - Offset Word; Reads a word from the ROM on current cursor
          position, treats it as an offset pointer on the cursor position. Then
          the data at destination position will be interpreted.

        * hw - Header offset Word; Reads a word from the ROM on current cursor
          position, treats it as an offset pointer on the header position. Then
          the data at destination position will be interpreted.

        * dl - Data Long; Reads a long from the ROM on current cursor position,
          and then increments the cursor position by 4.

        * ll - Last Long; Reads a long from the ROM on current cursor position
          minus 4.

        * nl - Next Long; Reads a long from the ROM on current cursor position.

        * sl - Skip Long; Increments the cursor position by 4, but does not
          read a long.

        * pc - PC: Gets the current cursor position as a word.

        * of - Offset: The origin offset of the file will be returned.

        * sz - Size: Returns the size of the file. To get the offset after last
          byte in the file, add of to value returned by sz.

        * an - Absolute Lable Next: Gets the next lable from the current cursor
          position. If no lable was found, the offset of the last byte after
          end of file is returned. It is equivalent of doing of+sz.

        * al - Absolute Lable Last: Gets the last lable from the current cursor
          position. If no lable was found, the offset of the file will be
          returned.

  *2.3 - Function format*
    *2.3.0 - Format*
      <format>
      <example 1>
      <example 2>
        <text describing the examples>

    *2.3.1 - Equates*
      =<lable> <value>
      =nRst 0x80
      =endian "little"
        <lable> is the lable of the equate, used to identify it. Having multiple
        equates with the same lable will likely break things. <value> is the
        value or statement evaluated to the string. The first time the equate is
        found on the script it will be evaluated and can not be evaluated again.

    *2.3.2 - Macro*
      !<flags> > <lable>: <arguments><end>
      ! > smpsHeaderVoice: /aw;
      !0xFF, 3 > smpsCopyData: /db, /db {
      !0xFA > smpsModOff:;
        <flags> is none, one, or more bytes which define the data necessary to
        trigger this macro, which are separated by ','. <lable> is the lable
        used to identify this macro, and functions as the macro name. Having
        multiple macros with the same lable will likely break things.
        <arguments> define the arguments of the macro, separated by ','. These
        will be evaluated when the macro is used. <end> will be ';' if you do
        not need additional code block. If you do, you use '{' instead.

    *2.3.3 - Argument modifier*
      :<num> {
      :4 {
        <num> is a 0-based offset of the argument that will be modified. This
        function always starts a new code block which define the possible
        argument lables.

    *2.3.4 - If block*
      Â¤ <condition> {
      Â¤ .nw == 0x17D8 {
      Â¤ false {
        <condition> defines on what basis the if block will evaluate when to run
        the true block (right after the line) or false block (after the first
        '}' if '{' is provided in same line). The script will be evaluated once
        the interpreter finds an if block.

    *2.3.5 - Operation*
      $ <operation>
      $ .sb
        <operation> will be the raw operation, typically consisting of operators
        only. The operation will be evaluated once the interpreter finds it. The
        operation may only contain operators or statements, not other functions.
        Operations are best used to skip bytes.

    *2.3.6 - For loop*
      * <times> {
      * \FMnum\ - 1 {
      * 0xA {
        <times> defines the amount of times the code block will be ran, which
        will be evaluated once the interpreter finds it. Most useful for
        defining variable size header fields, such as FM and PSG headers.

    *2.3.7 - Argument equate*
      @<lable> <argument> <text>
      @offset 0 "Please specify offset of this song in Z80 bank"
        <lable> will be the lable applied to the final evaluated equate when the
        interpreter finds it. <argument> is the argument offset from where it
        attempts to get the value from. In commandline this will be the argument
        3+<argument>. <text> will be shown on the screen if argument at
        specified offset could not be found. The user will be promted with this
        string to enter an input to evaluate the equate.

    *2.3.8 - Lable format*
      ~<string>
      ~Â£_PSG#
      ~Â£_DAC
        <string> is a string representing what the format for lable names will
        be. 'Â£' is special character which will be replaced with the given name
        of this project is. '#' is special character, which will be replaced
        with the next available number, starting from 1. Any lable created by
        the interpreter will be in this format until it is changed by the
        script. Most used to change lable names for jumps, calls, and channel
        definitions, etc.

      *2.3.9 - Subscript*
        ?<lable> {
        ?header {
          <lable> is used to identify this subscript by. This is used mostly to
          hold other functions, especially for system subscripts (for example
          coordination, header, note).

        *2.3.9.1 - Subscript importing*
          ?<lable>;
          ?header;
            <lable> is used to identify the subscript to import. This is used
            to import functions or equates from another subscript.

      *2.3.10 - Comment*
        %<note>
        %; This is a comment!
        %; The actual value was {.lb}
          <note> is the string you want to notify user with. All the operations
          you use must be between { and } tags.

      *2.3.11 - Print*
        +<note>
        +Hello World!
        +There is some error at {.pc}
          <note> is the string you want to notify user with. All the operations
          you use must be between { and } tags.

      *2.3.12 - Go to*
        ><type> <off>
        >a <dw>
        >b 10
          <type> is the type of the operation. 'a' is absolute addressÂ´, 'f' is
          forward via offset addition, 'b' is backward via offset substraction.
          <off> is the offset, evaluated once the interpreter finds the Go to.

      *2.3.13 - Arbitary Lable*
        ^ <offset>
        ^ .pc
        ^ .sz-10
          <offset> is the calculated offset of the offset where the lable will
          go at. This can contain any arbitary operators, except any that
          create lables themselves.
================================================================================

*3 - Inner functionality*
  *3.1 - Script parsing*
    Scripts are parsed line by line, tabs and carriage returns are ignored.
    The first letter of a line determines what type of function the line is
    assigned to do. Code blocks (including the entire script) is handle by a
    stack of of Dic elements, which are an easier way to interact with a
    Dictionary<?,?> in C#, as there is no implementation allowing you to
    define Dictionary with ambigious attributes. Reflection API is used to
    call functions within the Dictionary and then will be translated to
    appropriate objects during runtime. The stack will get objects pushed into
    it and popped from it by code block start and code block end respectively.
    If Dictionary operations fail or stack underflows, an error will be
    detected, the line number and error report is shown to the user and
    parsing will stop. Similarly, if an illegal line is found, the program
    attempts to warn the user as best as it can.

  *3.2 - Header parsing*
    Header is sort of a special case, because parsing it differs fair bit from
    parsing rest of the file. Unlike normal data, header field is read
    fully, and usually consist only of operations that always happen. While in
    header, equates are not treated as data, and data at offsets are not
    followed to. Other than that header is treated like any normal code section.

  *3.3 - Main data parsing*
    Main data is parsed by jumping into the offsets of lables found during
    header parsing or data parsing. The data will be parse until Stop token is
    found, and then the interpreter will return to the previous caller. Whenever
    Absolute Word or Offset Word operator is found, the address will be resolved
    and called. The data will be interpreted until a Stop is met, after which
    the caller will resume interpreting data. This can lead to duplicates of
    same data being resolved, but if this data is the same it will be discarded
    when the output file is written. The program will not at this stage check
    for unused data. The prasing function consist of two or more Dictionaries,
    which are related to coordination flags, DAC names or note names. The
    coordination flags always take priority over other Dictionaries. Main loop
    checks first if there is found a match in coordination flags. If so, the
    parsing function will return a boolean value, if a stop statement was met.
    If not, it will check if the byte offset changed during the parsing. If it
    did, it will check coordination flags again. If not, it will check for note
    or DAC equates. If even then it did not find a match, it will flag it as
    data, increment byte offset, and do the loop again, until it reaches a stop
    or end of the file.

  *3.4 - Parsing patches*
    Patch parsing is also a special case, much like header. Instead however,
    each 25 (as per SMPS standard, size can be changed to fit other standsrds)
    bytes, the patch script is executed, until another lable or end of file is
    met. Here, every operation is executed sequentially.

  *3.5 - Outputting to file*
    After the input file is fully parsed, the data will be written line by line
    to the output file. The loop will read each byte, and write any line on that
    byte. If there is multiple lines for the same byte, then the program checks
    if they are equivalent. If so, it ignores one of them, but if not, then it
    will warn the user, but print both anyway. The loop will also check for any
    lables at the current byte, and write them after the data. The loop will
    also format raw data or equated bytes into same line (max 8 per line), and
    check if any byte has not been found. There is a string with offset to
    every skipped byte, so it knows which bytes not to flag as unused.
