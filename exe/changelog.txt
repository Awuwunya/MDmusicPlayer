  s+ Go To, Equate Change and Comment functions
  s* Voices which are not at the end of file would continue to be created til
    end of file. This would eventually cause the ASM file to be messy and not
    work correctly.
  s* ReadWord function would read the first byte twice, and therefore break any
    code that uses it.
  s* Some miscellaneous crash issues
  s* Script parser would not support multiple condition blocks. False condition
    would get overwritten by another condition block, and then it would
    incorrectly run instructions when it should not. Now this also uses a stack
    and supports theoretically infinite condition blocks.
  s* Lable formats can now use variables or operators
  s* lable format would place ':' in wrong places or not at all with some setups
    This has now been corrected to always put one at the end.
  s* Various optimizations
